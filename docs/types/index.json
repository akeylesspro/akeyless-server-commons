        "interfaces - Exports from ./interfaces: All interfaces from interfaces/global.ts (MandatoryObject, MandatoryParams, LogRequests, AppOptions), All email interfaces from interfaces/email.ts (EmailData, EmailAttachment, EmailSettings)",

    "Convenience - Import multiple types from different categories in a single statement",

    "Type Safety - All exports maintain full TypeScript type information",
    "Discoverability - Easy to find and use types across the entire package"
